You can build your layouts as grids that are nested within other grids. For grid layouts, you can specify many visual parameters like row and column widths, the gap sizes between the rows and columns, or paddings. 2D axes have many more parameters like titles, labels, ticks, their sizes and colors and alignments, etc. All of these parameters are Observables and the layout updates itself automatically when you change them.","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html#","page":"MakieLayout.jl","title":"MakieLayout.jl","text":"As a starting point, here's one example that creates a fairly standard faceting layout like you might know from ggplot :","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html#","page":"MakieLayout.jl","title":"MakieLayout.jl","text":"using MakieLayout\nusing Makie\n\nscene = Scene(resolution = (1200, 900), camera=campixel!)\n\nnrows = 4\nncols = 5\n\n# Create the main GridLayout that is the parent of all other layout objects.\n# We set its own parent to the scene it belongs to, this way it will recompute\n# itself when the scene size changes, e.g., when you resize the window.\n# We also specify the `alignmode` as Outside, which means that everything\n# including the decorations of the grid content will fit into the window, with a\n# margin of 30px to each side\nmaingl = GridLayout(\n    nrows, ncols,\n    parent = scene,\n    alignmode = Outside(30, 30, 30, 30))\n\n# create a grid of LayoutedAxis objects and at the same time place them in the\n# grid layout with indexing syntax\nlas = [maingl[i, j] = LayoutedAxis(scene) for i in 1:nrows, j in 1:ncols]\n\n# link x and y axes of all LayoutedAxis objects\nlinkxaxes!(las...)\nlinkyaxes!(las...)\n\nfor i in 1:nrows, j in 1:ncols\n\n    # plot into the scene that is managed by the LayoutedAxis\n    scatter!(las[i, j], rand(200, 2) .+ [i j])\n\n    # remove unnecessary decorations in some of the facets, this will have an\n    # effect on the layout as the freed up space will be used to make the axes\n    # bigger\n    i > 1 && (las[i, j].attributes.titlevisible = false)\n    j > 1 && (las[i, j].attributes.ylabelvisible = false)\n    j > 1 && (las[i, j].attributes.yticklabelsvisible = false)\n    j > 1 && (las[i, j].attributes.yticksvisible = false)\n    i < nrows && (las[i, j].attributes.xticklabelsvisible = false)\n    i < nrows && (las[i, j].attributes.xticksvisible = false)\n    i < nrows && (las[i, j].attributes.xlabelvisible = false)\nend\n\n# index into the 0th row, thereby adding a new row into the layout and place\n# a text object across the full column width as a super title\nmaingl[0, :] = LayoutedText(scene, text=\"Super Title\", textsize=50)\n\n# place a title on the side by going from the second row to the last (because\n# in the first row, there is now the super title) and adding a column to the end\n# by indexing one column further than the last index\nmaingl[2:end, end+1] = LayoutedText(scene, text=\"Side Title\", textsize=50,\n    rotation=-pi/2)\n\nsave(\"example_intro.png\", scene); nothing # hide","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html#","page":"MakieLayout.jl","title":"MakieLayout.jl","text":"(Image: example intro)","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html#Nesting-grids-1","page":"MakieLayout.jl","title":"Nesting grids","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"index.html#","page":"MakieLayout.jl","title":"MakieLayout.jl","text":"Grids can be nested inside other grids, and so on, to arbitrary depths.

The choices are between fixed widths in pixels, relative widths in fractions of one, aspect ratio widths that are relative to a selected row or column, and auto widths. Auto widths depend on the content of the row or column. Some elements like LayoutedText have a determinable width or height. If there are single-span elements in a row that have a determinable height and the row's height is set to auto, it will assume the largest height of all determinable elements it contains. This is very useful for placement of text, or other GUI elements like buttons and sliders. If a row or column does not have a determinable height or width, it defaults to an equal share of the remaining space with all other auto rows or columns. You can adjust the ratio of this share with the Integer argument of the Auto struct.","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html#","page":"MakieLayout.jl","title":"MakieLayout.jl","text":"using MakieLayout\nusing Makie\n\nscene = Scene(resolution = (1200, 900), camera=campixel!)\n\nmaingl = GridLayout(\n    5, 5,\n    parent = scene,\n    colsizes = [Fixed(200), Relative(0.25), Auto(), Auto(), Auto(2)],\n    rowsizes = [Fixed(100), Relative(0.25), Aspect(2, 1), Auto(), Auto()],\n    alignmode = Outside(30, 30, 30, 30))\n\n\nfor i in 1:5, j in 1:5\n    if i == 5 && j == 3\n        maingl[i, j] = LayoutedText(scene, text=\"My Size is Inferred\")\n    else\n        maingl[i, j] = LayoutedAxis(scene, titlevisible=false,\n            xlabelvisible=false, ylabelvisible=false, xticklabelsvisible=false,\n            yticklabelsvisible=false)\n    end\nend\n\nsave(\"example_row_col_sizes.png\", scene); nothing # hide","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html#","page":"MakieLayout.jl","title":"MakieLayout.jl","text":"(Image: row col sizes)","category":"page"}]
